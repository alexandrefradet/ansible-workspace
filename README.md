# Ansible workspace

Just started to use Ansible. Used to manage my workspace installation on new computer with bash script.
Will try to transpose this in ansible.

## TODO :

- Generate and manage multiple ssh keys
- Generate .ssh/config based on theses keys
- Add source after bashrc & bash_aliases (handlers ?)
- Symbolic for bash files ?
